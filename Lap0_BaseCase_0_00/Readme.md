## Model Setup and Metadata

This lap includes a large-scale MESH model setup for **all of Canada** and **transboundary river basins** shared between Canada and the United States.

This is out of the box run with the default parameters for CLASS.ini and Hydrology.ini based on previous study.

Sub basin is aggregated to 100 km2

## Data Description

### Forcing Data

The model uses 7 key climate forcing variables from the **Canadian Surface Reanalysis (CaSR v2.1)** dataset [(Gasset et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-4269-2021), formerly known as RDRS2.1:

- Precipitation  
- Specific humidity  
- Air temperature  
- Longwave radiation  
- Shortwave radiation  
- Wind speed  
- Surface pressure  

### Geospatial Datasets

- **MERIT Hydro** – Terrain and river network data 
- **Landsat NALCMS 2022** – Land cover data from the North American Land Change Monitoring System
